# 🛡️ Home SOC Detection Lab

This project simulates real-world cybersecurity threats and shows how to detect them using open-source tools in a virtual home lab environment.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Windows Server 2022 with Sysmon
- Wazuh SIEM (on Ubuntu)
- Kali Linux (for attack simulation)
- MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

## 📂 Structure
- `lab-notes/` — Weekly setup and progress notes
- `screenshots/` — Visual evidence of detections and configurations
- `detection-reports/` — Incident write-ups for each scenario
- `mitre-attack-mapping/` — Technique breakdowns per MITRE ATT&CK

## 🚧 Project Status
🔨 Currently in **Week 1: Virtual Lab Setup**

Stay tuned for attack simulations and detection workflows!
